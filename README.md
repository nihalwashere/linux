## Getting started guide

### Google Cloud Platform

Setup Google Cloud CLI on your local machine to manage your compute engine resources via commands. Spin up a Linux instance by running the following command,

`gcloud compute instances create [YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME] --machine-type=n2-standard-8 --boot-disk-size=200 --enable-nested-virtualization`

Replace "YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME" with the name of your instance.

In the above command we are not specifying the zone since in our case the zone was configured and set to "us-west1-b" while installing Google Cloud CLI.

We are enabling nested virtualization by adding the flag "--enable-nested-virtualization".

### SSH into your instance

You can ssh into your instance using the following command,

`gcloud compute ssh --zone "YOUR_ZONE" "YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME" --project "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"`

Once you are inside the linux instance, you need to setup a couple of tools in order to execute and build the linux source tree.

### Install gcc and make

`sudo apt install gcc make`

### Clone a forked version of the linux GitHub repo

`git clone https://github.com/nihalwashere/linux`

### Build the linux source tree

Copy your instance's linux distribution config file to your cloned linux repo

`sudo cp /boot/config-5.10.0-19-cloud-amd64 .config`

### Read the existing config file that was used to build the old kernel, you will be prompted for options in the current kernel source

`make oldconfig`

#### Prepare for architecture

`make prepare`

#### Build the modules

`make -j 8 modules`

#### Build the source

`make -j 8`

#### Install modules

`sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install`

#### Install source

`sudo make install`

#### Reboot your instance

`sudo reboot`

#### Now you should be able to see your updated linux version when you run the below command

`uname -a`

### Install virt-install

`virt-install` is a command line tool to provision new virtual machines

### Create a nested virtual machine

The below command will help you to create a virtual machine named 'ubuntu-1' with two virtual CPU's and 2 GB of RAM, the OS variant is ubuntu20.04. Since we are operating through the CLI hence we are specifying `--graphics none` and we would like to access the nested virtual machine through the serial console.

`sudo virt-install --name ubuntu-1 --os-variant ubuntu20.04 --vcpus 2 --ram 2048 --location http://ftp.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/ --network bridge=virbr0,model=virtio --graphics none --extra-args='console=ttyS0,115200n8 serial'`

Follow the prompts on your screen to finish setting up your nested virtual machine.

#### List your virtual machines

`virsh list --all`

#### Access your nested virtual machine through the console

`virsh console ubuntu-1`

#### Now you should be able to access the prompt of the nested virtual machine

`ubuntu-1`

### Update your `kvm` module

Follow the guidelines as described in the assignment and make changes to the `linux/arch/x86/kvm/cpuid.c` and `linux/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c` files.

After modification, run the below commands to build your kernel source tree for the changes to take effect.

1. `make -j 8 modules`

2. `make -j 8`

3. `sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install`

### Build your `kvm` module

Check if `kvm` module is already loaded

`lsmod | grep kvm`

Remove `kvm` if already loaded

1. `sudo rmmod  kvm_intel`
2. `sudo rmmod  kvm`

Load updated kvm modules

1. `sudo modprobe kvm`
2. `sudo modprobe kvm_intel`

## Test your code

### Install `cpudid` package on your nested virtual machine

1. `sudo apt-get update`

2. `sudo apt-get install cpuid`

### Test leaf node 0x4FFFFFFC

Run the following command inside your nested virtual machine

`cpuid -1 -l 0x4ffffffc`

You should be able to see an output like below

### Test leaf node 0x4FFFFFFD

Run the following command inside your nested virtual machine

`cpuid -1 -l 0x4ffffffd`

You should be able to see an output like below

![alt text](./output2.png)

### Test leaf node 0x4FFFFFFE

Run the following `C` script inside your nested virtual machine. We are testing the exit type 0 (check input value for ecx).

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

static inline void
__cpuid(unsigned int *eax, unsigned int *ebx, unsigned int *ecx,
unsigned int *edx)
{
    asm volatile("cpuid"
    : "=a" (*eax),
    "=b" (*ebx),
    "=c" (*ecx),
    "=d" (*edx)
    : "0" (*eax), "1" (*ebx), "2" (*ecx), "3" (*edx));
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    unsigned int eax, ebx, ecx, edx;
    unsigned long long time;

    eax = 0x4FFFFFFE;
    ecx = 0;
    __cpuid(&eax, &ebx, &ecx, &edx);
    printf("######################\n");
    printf("CPUID(0x4FFFFFFE), EXIT=%u, EXIT CYCLES=%u\n", ecx, eax);
}
```

You should be able to see an output like below

### Test leaf node 0x4FFFFFFF

Run the following `C` script inside your nested virtual machine. We are testing the exit type 0 (check input value for ecx).

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

static inline void
__cpuid(unsigned int *eax, unsigned int *ebx, unsigned int *ecx,
unsigned int *edx)
{
    asm volatile("cpuid"
    : "=a" (*eax),
    "=b" (*ebx),
    "=c" (*ecx),
    "=d" (*edx)
    : "0" (*eax), "1" (*ebx), "2" (*ecx), "3" (*edx));
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    unsigned int eax, ebx, ecx, edx;
    unsigned long long time;

    eax = 0x4FFFFFFE;
    ecx = 0;
    __cpuid(&eax, &ebx, &ecx, &edx);
    printf("######################\n");
    printf("CPUID(0x4FFFFFFF), EXIT PROCESSING TIME HIGH 32 BITS=%u, EXIT PROCESSING TIME LOW 32 BITS=%u\n", ebx, ecx);
}
```

You should be able to see an output like below

## Questions

1. Comment on the frequency of exits â€“ does the number of exits increase at a stable rate? Or are there
   more exits performed during certain VM operations? Approximately how many exits does a full VM
   boot entail?

- Upon observing, we noticed that the frequency of exits increases gradually. There are more exits whenever a VM is booting. On testing we found that the total number of exits during a full VM boot is `956591`. But of course this is not a hard number and it will change on every VM boot. The total number of exits could be more or less.

2. Of the exit types defined in the SDM, which are the most frequent? Least?

- The most frequent exit type is `48` and the least is `47`, however, there are a lot of exit types which are not executed at all and their exit frequency is `0`.

Output for exit reason 47

Output for exit reason 48
